Hi-Story Example

brief:"""
I'm interested in history these days. But I figured out that I cannot remember too much details. Sometimes I want a memo to bring my memory back.
So I looked for history memo and time-line software, but I didn't find the one that is satisfied for me. I just do it myself.
